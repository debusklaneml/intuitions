# Overview: 

This repository will contain various apps or functions that I think are pretty nifty at helping users understand, perhaps intuitives, common statistical phenomenons. 


# Effect Size: 
`intuition_es.R` is a simple R shiny app that allows users to manipulate data to understand how shifts in sample size, variability, and means can influence both p-values (from t-tests) and effect sizes.
